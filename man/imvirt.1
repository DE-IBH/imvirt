.TH "IMVIRT" "1"
.SH "NAME"
imvirt \- detects several virtualizations
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
\fBimvirt\fR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the \fBimvirt\fR script.
\fBimvirt\fR tries to detect if it runs on a physical machine or on a
virtualized one. If it detects that it is a virtualized one it also tries to
find out which virtualization technology is used.
.SH "USAGE"
\fBimvirt\fR does not need any arguments.
But there is at the moment a restriction if you do not call this script with
the administrative root user, because \fBimvirt\fR also uses \fBdmidecode\fR to
determine the used virtualization technology. \fBdmidecode\fR itself needs root
privileges to accesss /dev/mem. So on you have to wrap \fBimvirt\fR with sudo
if you want to detect every virtualization technology.
