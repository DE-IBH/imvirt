About:
  imvirt tries to detect if it runs on a physical machine or on a
  virtualized one. If it detects that it is a virtualized one it also
  tries to find out which virtualization technology is used.

Usage:
  imvirt [-d]
    -d			enable debug output

Output:
EOH

    print "    ",join("\n    ", imv_get_pos_results()),"\n\n";
