Changes in 0.9.0
================

The previous imvirt script has been ported into a perl package framework.

package tree:

ImVirt.pm		- generic interface to use the imvirt framework
ImVirt::Utils::...	- common helper modules used by ImVirt::VMD::* packages
ImVirt::VMD::...	- Virtual Machine Detection packages

New VMD packages can ne added by putting them into perl's search path.
ImVirt.pm uses Module::Find to load any ImVirt::VMD::* package.

The new imvirt script can be used as a dropin replacement for the old 
legacy imvirt script.
