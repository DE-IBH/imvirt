imvirt - I'm virtualized?
-------------------------

This script tries to detect if it is run under a (para)virtualization.
This is done by looking for wellknown boot messages, device names,
installed tools etc.

Detected virtualizations:
 - Virtual PC/Server
 - VMware
 - QEMU/KVM (experimental)
 - Xen (para and non-para virtualized)
 - OpenVZ/Virtuozzo

imvirt is comparable with virt-what [1]. imvirt was written to run as
non-root - virt-what requires to be run as root but gives some more
details on Xen (Dom0/DomU/HVM).
