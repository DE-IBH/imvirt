imvirt - I'm virtualized?
-------------------------

This script tries to detect if it is run under a (para)virtualization.
This is done by looking for wellknown boot messages, device names,
installed tools etc.

Detected virtualizations:
 - ARAnyM
 - KVM
 - lguest
 - LXC
 - OpenVZ/Virtuozzo
 - QEMU
 - UML
 - VMware GSX, ESX, Workstation
 - Virtual PC/Virtual Server
 - VirtualBox
 - Xen (para and non-para virtualized)
 - any HVM providing CPUID 0x40000000 detection

imvirt is comparable with virt-what [1]. imvirt was written to run as
non-root - virt-what requires to be run as root but had some more
details on Xen (Dom0/DomU/HVM) in the past.
