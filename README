imvirt - I'm virtualized?
-------------------------

This script tries to detect if it is run under a (para)virtualization.
This is done by looking for wellknown boot messages, device names,
installed tools etc.

Detected virtualizations:
 - Virtual PC/Server
 - VMware
 - QEMU/KVM (experimental)
 - Xen (para and non-para virtualized)
